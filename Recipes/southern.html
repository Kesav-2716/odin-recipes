    <p>Love is in the air. No wait, it’s just the smell of good BBQ.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large cloves cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>10 chicken drumsticks</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>½ cup finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Receipe Instruction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash brown sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a mortar and pestle to form a paste. Spoon paste into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken, coat with the paste, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.</li><br>
        <li>Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir ketchup, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into onions; bring to a simmer and cook until flavors blend, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from bag and discard marinade.</li><br>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until lightly browned on all sides, about 1 minute per side.</li><br>
        <li>Turn off one of the grill burners or move the coals and move chicken so there is no heat source directly below it.</li><br>
        <li>Baste drumsticks with the sauce and cook another 10 minutes; turn again and baste chicken with sauce. Continue to grill drumsticks until juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
