    <p>Embrace the sloppiness of this smoked pulled chicken!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>1 ½ cups plain low-fat yogurt</li>
       <li>3 cloves garlic, mashed to a paste</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground black peppe</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
       <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken, split lengthwise</li>
       <li>cherry wood chips</li>
   </ul> 
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Combine yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, pepper, salt, paprika, and cumin in an extra-large zip-top bag. Add chicken halves, making sure they are completely coated. Squeeze out excess air, seal the bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li><br>
       <li>Thirty minutes before cooking, soak the wood chips in water. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li><br>
       <li>Sprinkle the soaked wood chips directly over the hot coals. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Place chicken, skin-side down, on the hot side of the preheated grill. Discard the remaining marinade.</li><br>
       <li>Cook chicken until grill marks form, about 4 minutes. Flip and transfer to the cooler side of the grill. Cover and cook, occasionally rotating 180 degrees, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 175 degrees F (79 degrees C), about 45 minutes.</li><br>
       <li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove and discard skin. Pick all meat from the bones and shred it using 2 forks.</li>
